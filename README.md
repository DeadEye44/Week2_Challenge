# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

This weeks task was to create a web application from scratch. I built a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. Along side that I built a CSS page that I can use to display the portfolio pages in a fun way. This is a living document that will grow over time to look like a professionally styled portfolio page, serving to showcase my skills as a web developer.
